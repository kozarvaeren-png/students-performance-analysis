Hi guys. My name is Eren, and I study Management Information Systems (MIS) in Turkey. I'm currently in my second year.

I'm at the beginning of my Machine Learning journey, and this is one of my first projects created to practice Python, NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

The project simulates student performance data (grades, study hours, sports activities, etc.) and includes some basic analysis & visualization.

As I keep learning, I'll create more advanced and complex projects. Thanks for reading.
